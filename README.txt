Class CS245A2:
1. readInput() reads and processes the input file and adds data to instance of class Graph. 
2. inputName() takes two arguments and updates global variables actor names.
3. nameExists() tests if an actor exists in the input file using Graph function.
4. getPath() gets the shortest path between the two actors from Graph function
5. main(): driver function

Class Graph:
1. addEdge() add edges between each actor in the list with all other actors.
2. findShortestPath() takes two arguments as two actors and finds the shortest path between the two actors.
3. isInGraph() checks if an actor exists in the graph.
